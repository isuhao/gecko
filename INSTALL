Prerequisites
-------------

GECKO needs a 2.6.x kernel to function. Older kernels are not supported.
Find out your current kernel version using: uname -a

GECKO depends on the following libraries:

* libgsl
* libqt4
* libsamdsp
* lib_sis3100
* lib_sis3150


libgsl and the Qt4 libraries can usually be installed from the package repositories
of your linux distribution.

---

libsamdsp can be compiled from source from the svn repository.
Pleaser refer to the documentation in 

svn/taggersoftware/trunk/samdsp

---

lib_sis3100 and lib_sis3150 can be compiled from source from the svn repository.
To do this change into the directory:

cd svn/taggersoftware/trunk/sisdev/sis3100_calls

And make the library with:

make clean
make

Repeat this step for the other directory:

cd svn/taggersoftware/trunk/sisdev/sis3100_calls
make clean
make

---

Compiling GECKO
---------------

Change into the gecko source directory

cd svn/taggersoftware/trunk/sisdev/gecko

And compile the code:

make clean
qmake-qt4
make
